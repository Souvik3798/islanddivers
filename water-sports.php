                    <p class="post-modern-text">Scuba Diving is one of the most popular water sports activities in the world and Andaman Islands aren’t untouched by that. Besides the calm, peaceful beaches and delicious seafood, diving is what attracts a good chunk of visitors to the Isles.

                      The underwater coastal belts surrounding Andamans is home to one of the densest ecosystem of coral reefs and formations.

                      Most of the islands are enclosed by long stretches of reefs, usually several hundred meters wide and separated by the shore with shallow waters and complimented by volcanic lava hills that make the experience unique and hard to find anywhere else. </p>

                    <p class="post-modern-text">Introduced in 2020, Seakart is an adrenaline filled water-sports available for the first time in India and launched in the third destination in the world after Mauritius & Dubai at Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

                      The Seakart itself is a novel watercraft that is built like a go kart, hence the name, which delivers the best of everything in one single adventure.
                      <br>
                      The activity involves the guest self-driving the Seakart under the guidance of a licensed instructor along the coast of Port Blair on a long route.
                      The Seakart is made to fit 3 people, but unlike jet skis and speed boats who are allowed only near the shorelines, Seakart actually goes a step further and allows you to explore the wavy deep seas far from the shoreline, driving all by yourself, making it one of the most unique experiences to have in Port Blair.

                    <p class="post-modern-text">Parasailing lets you experience the scenic beauty of the Andamans, from the Sky. Surfing with the wind through the sea with your bare legs and taking small dips in the sea with every wind thrust just refreshes your day.


                      <br>
                      ​One long pull from the boat and you will soar high on the sky in a second and can witness one of the best views that Andaman has to offer.

                      ​Flying free above all else and gazing at the all green and blue shades of the islands is an experience that is second to none and the memories from them will, without a doubt, last a lifetime.

                    <p class="post-modern-text">Better than swimming and much more affordable than Scuba, Snorkeling is a sport that takes you to the magnificent underwater world without the need for any complex setup or apparatus.<br>

                      What makes the experience great is that you don't have to prepare anything in advance, you can just grab the gear, go dive into the water, and feel the weight of your body fade away.

                      Andaman Islands offer some of the best places to snorkel so you can easily explore the world of sea-dwellers. The highly-populated ecosystem of shoreline in the isles is home to a wide variety of corals, both hard & soft that houses a plethora of beautiful fish species to gaze at.<br>

                      The preserved coastal belts surrounded by long stretches of diverse ecosystem is a wonderful sight to experience and we recommend it everyone, who comes on a vacation to Andaman.
